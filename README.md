This project bridges LDPC error correction with real-world memory systems, particularly NAND flash and DRAM technologies used in SSDs and mobile devices. LDPC codes are not just theoretical toolsâ€”they are core components of modern memory controllers, enabling reliable data storage in high-density, error-prone environments.
