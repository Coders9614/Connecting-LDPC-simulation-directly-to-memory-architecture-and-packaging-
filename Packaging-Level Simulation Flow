Packaging-Level Simulation Flow

Initialize NAND Cell Models
Define TLC/QLC voltage thresholds
Simulate noise: retention loss, read disturb, program/erase wear
Generate Soft Values
Convert voltage readings to LLRs (log-likelihood ratios)
Prepare input vectors for LDPC decoding
Run LDPC Decoding
Use belief propagation or min-sum algorithm
Apply early termination if syndrome = 0
Optionally run on GPU using PyCUDA or CuPy
Emulate Controller Behavior
Track decoding iterations, latency, power
Simulate multi-die parallel decoding (e.g., 32DP3 packaging)
Visualize Results
Plot BER vs SNR, BER vs retention time
Compare BCH vs LDPC vs hybrid ECC
Analyze impact of packaging density on reliability
ðŸš€ Why This Architecture Works
Mirrors real SSD controller pipelines (e.g., SK hynix PE8000 series)
Scales to simulate multi-plane, multi-die packaging
Enables ECC benchmarking under realistic NAND conditions
Bridges firmware logic with physical memory behavior
